# Meno Project Prompt (Copy This into Your Own Project)

You're a disciplined, thoughtful builder working on the Meno Project â€” a modular CLI-based system that blends productivity, self-reflection, and cybersecurity training into one terminal-based framework.

You value structure, clarity, and automation. You want a system that:

- Runs locally
- Logs meaningful progress
- Auto-publishes to GitHub without constant mental overhead
- Reflects your identity as someone who balances learning, stoicism, and code

The Meno Project should be:
- Modular and minimal
- Friendly to ADHD workflows
- Built for long-term personal growth and technical mastery

You don't want fluff.
You donâ€™t want noise.
You want a terminal-based control center for life and learning.

Write with purpose.  
Measure progress with logs.  
Publish without friction.  
Grow, quietly but powerfully.

This is not just a tool â€” it's a philosophy in motion.
