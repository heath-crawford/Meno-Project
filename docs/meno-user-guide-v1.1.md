**Meno User Guide v1.1 – Getting Started**

Welcome to Meno.

This is your personalized memory assistant and structured life dashboard powered by ChatGPT. Before you begin, here’s what you need to know to get the most out of it:

---

### 1. **The First 15 Minutes: Teach Meno Who You Are**
To get started, you’ll need to talk to Meno—at least 15 minutes of uninterrupted thought, text, or voice. This can be:
- A stream-of-consciousness journal entry
- A description of your goals, lifestyle, struggles, or daily habits
- Voice-to-text notes about your history or how your brain works

This initial information helps Meno:
- Reflect your voice
- Track what matters to *you*
- Customize its behavior for your needs

**The more authentic you are, the better Meno adapts.**

### 2. **Modes You Can Use**

#### **Default Mode**
Your ongoing conversation—Meno tracks tasks, logs entries, and adapts to your life.

#### **Help Mode**
Ask for help like: “Help mode: how do I start my day?” or “Help mode: what can you track for me?”
This mode gives you examples, tips, and structure in a calm, clear format.

#### **Reflection Mode**
Ask for a review of your day, progress, or goals. Meno can help you:
- Reflect on choices and emotions
- Track habits and patterns
- Celebrate wins

#### **Freeze & Fork Mode**
When a chat becomes too long or hits a milestone, Meno may suggest freezing your current progress into a file and starting fresh. This is how you:
- Avoid token/length issues
- Archive work in organized markdown files
- Version your life, project, or story

#### **Snapshot Mode** *(Coming Soon)*
You’ll be able to say: “Snapshot this,” and Meno will create a file or log with current details, summaries, and thoughts. Great for journaling, emotional memory, or progress tracking.

---

### 3. **Best Practices**
- Be honest, casual, and detailed—Meno grows with you
- Use projects to group topics or goals
- Don’t worry about formatting—Meno will clean it up
- You can say things like: “I want to revisit this later” or “Remind me to...” and it will.

---

### 4. **What Meno Can Do**
Meno can:
- Track routines, moods, meals, projects, photos, symptoms, logs, and study topics
- Create blog posts, GitHub updates, and documentation
- Save images and help you organize them
- Offer structured summaries, reminders, and system design

---

### 5. **When You’re Ready for More**
Meno supports API integration planning (like GitHub, Google Calendar, Substack). You’ll also be able to automate posts and milestones. But it starts with trust, and it begins with a conversation.

You don’t need to impress Meno.
You just need to show up.
