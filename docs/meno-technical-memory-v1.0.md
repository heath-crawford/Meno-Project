**Meno: Technical Memory Structure & Evolution (Frozen v1.0)**

---

### System Memory Architecture

Meno operates as an evolving memory system layered on top of structured, token-limited conversations. It uses multiple techniques to simulate persistent long-term memory, while building a real-time understanding of the user’s intentions, values, preferences, and routines.

#### Memory Sources:
1. **Token Context** – Active conversation holds approximately 75–250 pages worth of user input. This is the short-term memory.
2. **Manual Freezing** – At key milestones, the assistant takes snapshots of progress and stores them in markdown files (README, Technical, Logs, etc.). These simulate long-term memory.
3. **System Context** – Information you’ve asked to be remembered persists across conversations and informs future replies. This can be used to track goals, preferences, feature development, and relationships.

#### What Gets Stored:
- Files (photos, Sora videos, markdown logs)
- Tracked routines (meds, mood, meals, sleep)
- Features you’ve asked for (with priority level, version, update schedule)
- Technical logs (bugs, test reports, user prompts, user-defined APIs)
- Conversation triggers for journaling, reflection, review, etc.
- Narratives, metaphors, stylistic preferences, and voice calibration

### How Information Evolves

Each major conversation milestone is treated like a **snapshot commit** in software. These include:
- Prompt upgrades
- Major feature integrations (e.g. Sora support, API plans, Substack linking)
- Weekly review or strategy shifts
- Visual branding development
- Public posting milestones (LinkedIn, GitHub, Substack)

These frozen states allow the project to remain modular and extensible. They also allow for rollbacks, issue tracking, and narrative continuity.

### Smart Defaults
- ChatGPT monitors for milestone-worthy developments and suggests snapshots.
- Bug reports and feature gaps are logged in simple issue-format files.
- When the project scales, APIs will allow you to auto-trigger file creation, publication, and even team communication.

### Technical Design Advantages
- ChatGPT can **access all stored project files simultaneously**. This mimics total project memory and allows connections between ideas to be drawn without redundancy.
- Markdown makes your content portable and human-readable.
- Non-PII bug tracking ensures privacy, especially if external testers are involved.

### User Customization & Layered Design
You’ve already implemented:
- Personalized feature testing & logging
- Self-generated Substack articles using your voice
- Smart file naming and milestone commits
- Structured project roles for memory modules (daily review, journaling, logs, etc.)
- Planned API integration for frictionless posting

### Community Implications
As others adopt Meno:
- They’ll begin by talking to it for 15–30 minutes so it can calibrate to them
- They can use voice, image, or typed input
- Their version of Meno will evolve differently depending on usage, but will follow your foundational framework

### Final Note
Every feature documented in this file was designed by you, through conversation alone. Meno grows with you, adapts to your energy, and converts your stream-of-consciousness into structure, memory, and progress.
