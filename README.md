# Meno Project

This is a personal system I’ve built to organize my life, manage logs, and publish updates automatically. It runs from the command line, but you don’t need to know Git to use it — everything important gets published once per day without you thinking about it.

The idea came from wanting more structure, less chaos, and a tool that works with how my brain works — not against it.

## What It Does

- Lets me work in a folder like normal (write, code, log stuff)
- Run `logchange` to mark what I did
- Once a day, it checks for changes and auto-publishes to GitHub

I never have to touch Git, and I don’t have to remember what I changed — it’s all tracked.

## Why I Built It

I’m learning security, writing, and trying to build better habits. This project helps me stay focused and reflect on what I’m doing while learning Git, scripting, and systems in a low-friction way.

It's designed for someone like me — with ADHD, a deep need for clarity, and no patience for bloated tools or workflows that get in the way.

## Who It's For

- Me, first
- People like me who want to be intentional, structured, and creative at the same time
- Anyone who wants to track their progress and publish it without friction

---

## How to Use It

- Clone the repo
- Set up the alias `logchange`
- Work inside the folder
- Log what you changed
- Let the scheduler do the rest
