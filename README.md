# Meno: A Fractal Memory System

**Version:** 1.1 (April 3, 2025)  
**Status:** Actively evolving  
**Project Name:** Meno *(from the Greek for “memory”)*

---

## Overview
Meno is a personal and modular life-organization system designed to work *with* your brain — especially for ADHD users and creative thinkers. It’s powered by conversational inputs, multimodal features like Sora video integration, and structured versioning we call **Fractal Memory**.

This README reflects **Version 1.1**, a milestone that includes daily logging, memory tracking, dynamic visual storytelling, milestone-aware versioning, and Substack narrative generation.

> ⚠️ *Note: Meno is growing rapidly. Each version introduces new tools and features. Expect frequent updates.*

## What Is Fractal Memory?
Fractal Memory is a structured system that breaks down your long-term chat history into **defined milestones** (approx. every 75–250 pages). Each version:
- Has its own README and system prompt.
- Can generate narrative Substack posts, GitHub updates, and structured memory logs.
- Is archived like a page in a journal — readable, searchable, and self-contained.

**Why it matters:** You keep the *voice*, *structure*, and *value* of your thoughts even as chats grow large or get split up. You are building your own knowledge vault, one snapshot at a time.

## Core Features (v1.1)
- **Daily Check-ins**: Structured prompts each morning and night.
- **Mood, Food & Routine Logs**: Designed to detect patterns in energy, cravings, mood.
- **Wildcard Dinners & Family Logging**: Tracks meals, photos, and stories in a way that feels meaningful.
- **Substack Story Generator**: Auto-writes short stories using your own tone and day’s events.
- **Sora Video Integration**: Matches visual metaphors with your day’s events or internal state.
- **Bug Testing Framework**: Auto-generates silent issue reports and marks for improvement.
- **Private Photo Vaults**: Stores private progress photos using opt-in keywords only.
- **Fractal Versioning**: Freezes chats every 75–250 pages to preserve learnings and system states.
