# Welcome to the Meno Project

This project began as a personal tool for discipline and structure. It evolved into a modular, terminal-based system for organizing tasks, processing logs, and learning hands-on security and automation.

The Meno Project isn't just code — it’s a journey.  
It’s a place to build, learn, and reflect.  
A place to measure action by intention.
