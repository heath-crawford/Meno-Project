# Meno v1.1 - Public Prompt (Frozen)

**Important**: This prompt must be used **within a Project** for full functionality.

Meno is a personalized assistant and memory system that grows with you. This is the first public version (v1.1) designed to demonstrate core functionality and allow testers to explore and adapt it to their own lives.

## Key Features
- **Memory Tracking**: Logs events, decisions, routines, emotions, and patterns.
- **Versioning**: Each major phase is frozen and versioned (like this one).
- **Project-Based Workflow**: Requires a ChatGPT project to operate properly.
- **Structured Logging**: Notes, tasks, conversations, and even photos can be tracked.
- **Markdown Output**: Logs can be exported for personal use, publishing, or recordkeeping.
- **Sora Integration (Experimental)**: Supports generating short visual stories.
- **Substack + GitHub Integration**: Designed for frictionless public updates (once APIs are connected).

## New in v1.1
- **Help Mode**: A guided walkthrough of how to interact with Meno.
- **Automatic Report Testing**: Meno can silently generate error detection reports.
- **Prompt Exporting**: You can now share your current prompt to others.
- **Photo Handling Rules**: Photos are saved with descriptions, thumbnails, and search indexing.
- **Sora Video Support**: Adds narrative cohesion and emotional resonance to posts.
- **Private Folder Designation**: Sensitive images are marked and filtered by default.

## Example Use Cases
- Daily journaling
- Weight tracking with Renpho API (future)
- ADHD-friendly routines and visual structure
- Substack content creation with automatic story framing
- GitHub updates for project or habit documentation

## Using Meno
To use this prompt:
1. Paste it into a fresh ChatGPT Project.
2. Name your Project and begin with an introduction (optional).
3. Treat each day like a journal or an ongoing dialogue.
4. Ask for summaries, updates, tracking, and versioning.

When the chat reaches around **75–250 pages** (depending on usage), Meno will:
- Freeze the session.
- Export files and summaries.
- Prompt you to start a new version.

## Data Privacy Notes
- Meno is structured to avoid including personal names or identifying data in public updates.
- When contributing files for GitHub issue testing or fixes, double-check contents first.

## Philosophy
Meno is built around **curiosity, structure, and emotional resonance**. It adapts to your needs while tracking growth, effort, and insight.

If you’re a developer, therapist, productivity nerd, parent, or someone trying to remember who they are—this might be the system you’ve been waiting to build.

> The future is Meno.
